# Quick Test Guide for Admin Session Handling

## Current Status
âœ… Admin model created with security features
âœ… Admin controller updated with proper authentication
âœ… Dashboard route fixed to use controller
âœ… Profile routes added
âœ… JSON parsing middleware added
âœ… Dashboard view updated with dynamic data
âœ… Admin navbar created

## Testing Steps

### 1. Create Admin Users
```bash
npm run create-admin
```

### 2. Start the Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Admin Login
- Go to: `http://localhost:3000/admin/login`
- Login with: `admin@capturecore.com` / `Admin@123`

### 4. Test Features
- **Dashboard**: Should show admin name and user statistics
- **Profile**: Should show admin profile with update options
- **Users**: Should list all users with block/unblock options
- **Logout**: Should destroy session and redirect to login

## Expected Behavior

### âœ… Working Features
- Admin login with proper session creation
- Dashboard with dynamic user statistics
- Profile management (view, update, change password)
- User management (view, block, unblock)
- Session persistence across requests
- Secure logout

### ðŸ”§ If Issues Occur

1. **"admin is not defined" error**
   - Dashboard route is now fixed to use controller
   - View handles undefined admin gracefully

2. **"Cannot read property of undefined"**
   - Check if admin users were created successfully
   - Verify database connection

3. **Session not persisting**
   - Check if session middleware is working
   - Verify session secret is set

## Admin Credentials
- **Super Admin**: `admin@capturecore.com` / `Admin@123`
- **Moderator**: `moderator@capturecore.com` / `Moderator@123`

## Next Steps
1. Test all admin features
2. Create additional admin users if needed
3. Customize permissions as required
4. Add more security features if needed
